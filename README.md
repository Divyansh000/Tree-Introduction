# Tree-Introduction
Here i have provided code of tree data structure
Tree:- It is a collection of nodes connected by links to form heirarchy
B-Tree is of 4 types
1 strict B-Tree
2 complete B-Tree
3 perfect B-Tree
4 Degenerate B-Tree
Tree can be traversed by
1 Inorder Traversal
2 Preorder traversal
3 Postorder traversal
Here i have written code of all traversal
Learning :-tree implementation,uses of recursion
